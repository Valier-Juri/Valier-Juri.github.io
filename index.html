I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in mathematics. My primary interests in mathematics lie in the areas of Graph Theory and Metric Geometry.<br>

I am also passionate about data science, machine learning, and Human-Computer Interaction. I work at the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/">People and Robot Laboratory</a> under the guidance of Yaxin Hu and Prof. Bilge Mutlu as a research assistant. I was also a Tutor at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>, mentoring Pre-calculus and Calculus courses.<br>

I like hiking in the beautiful landscapes surrounding Madison or kayaking on Lake Mendota, I find that spending time in nature is rejuvenating and offers a fresh perspective on problem-solving and creativity. I also do a lot of drawings, mostly with techniques similar to Romanticism and Neo-impressionism.
