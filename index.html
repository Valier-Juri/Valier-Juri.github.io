I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in mathematics. My primary interests in mathematics lie in the areas of Graph Theory and Metric Geometry. 

I am also passionate about data science, machine learning, and Human-Computer Interaction. I work at the People and Robot Laboratory under the guidance of Yaxin Hu and Prof. Bilge Mutlu as a research assistant. I was also a Tutor at Math Learning Center, teaching Pre-calculus and Calculus courses.
