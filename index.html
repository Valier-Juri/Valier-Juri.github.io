I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in mathematics. My primary interests in mathematics lie in the areas of Graph Theory and Metric Geometry.

I am also passionate about data science, machine learning, and Human-Computer Interaction. I work at the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/">People and Robot Laboratory</a> under the guidance of Yaxin Hu and Prof. Bilge Mutlu as a research assistant. I was also a Tutor at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>, mentoring Pre-calculus and Calculus courses.
